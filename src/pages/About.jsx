      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Companies Directory</strong> is a modern web application designed to help users discover, explore, and analyze companies
        across different industries and regions. Built with a focus on clarity and usability, the platform allows users to quickly
        search, filter, and sort through company listings with an intuitive interface.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        The project was developed as part of the <strong>Frontlines Media Frontend Developer Assessment</strong> to demonstrate expertise
        in building dynamic and interactive web applications. Every feature—from responsive layouts to data handling—is implemented
        following best practices in modern frontend development.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        This application leverages <strong>React.js</strong> for component-driven UI development, <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> for styling and
        responsiveness, and <strong>TypeScript</strong> for type safety and maintainability. The combination of these technologies ensures
        high performance, scalability, and a clean development workflow.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        The core features include advanced <strong>search and filtering</strong> options, <strong>pagination</strong> for large datasets, and
        smooth UI transitions for a seamless user experience. Data visualization and company insights can be extended easily as the
        application is built to scale with modular components and reusable logic.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        Beyond the technical aspects, the project emphasizes <strong>user experience</strong>—offering fast navigation, clear typography,
        and a layout that adapts beautifully across devices. Whether you’re on desktop, tablet, or mobile, the app maintains a consistent
        and polished look.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        Future updates will include company profile pages, integration with real-time APIs, and an admin dashboard for managing listings
        more efficiently. The goal is to continue evolving this project into a fully functional and data-rich platform for professional
        use.
